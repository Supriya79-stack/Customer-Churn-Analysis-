# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes customer churn behavior using Tableau for interactive visualization and Python for exploratory data analysis. The goal is to identify key churn drivers and deliver actionable insights that inform customer retention strategies.

---

## 📊 Objective

To explore behavioral and demographic patterns in churned customers and visualize how factors like support interactions, spending, and contract types impact churn rates.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

* **Tableau**: Dashboard creation and visualization
* **Python (pandas, matplotlib)**: Data exploration and validation
* **Google Colab**: For documenting and analyzing raw data
* **GitHub**: Project versioning and showcase

---

## 🔍 Business Questions

* Which customer behaviors most strongly predict churn?
* Does contract length or subscription type affect retention?
* Do high-spending customers churn less?
* What early signs (e.g. payment delay, support calls) signal churn risk?

---

## 📊 Key Business Insights

* **72% churn** when **avg. payment delay > 10 days** — a strong early warning indicator.
* **41% of high spenders** still churn — proving that **spend ≠ loyalty**.
* **62% churn** on **basic subscriptions** vs. 39% on premium plans.
* **Monthly contract holders** have the **highest churn rate**.

---

## ✅ Outcomes

* Built an interactive Tableau dashboard summarizing customer churn KPIs and segment analysis.
* Highlighted that **service experience** (support calls, payment delays) drives churn more than monetary value.
* Segmented churn by **age**, **contract type**, **subscription plan**, and **payment behavior**.
* Used Python for EDA to validate Tableau findings and ensure consistent metrics.
* Delivered insights that support more targeted and proactive retention strategies.

## 💡 Business Analysis Summary

Despite some customers spending heavily, **churn is mainly caused by service friction** (e.g., support issues and late payments).
Short-term contracts and low-tier plans also show high churn, reflecting **value perception and commitment** gaps.
Focusing retention efforts on these behavioral and plan-based risk groups can reduce overall churn.
